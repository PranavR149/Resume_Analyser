# Project Description
The Resume Scanner project leverages Google Gemini AI to create an interactive web application that helps users optimize their resumes based on specific job descriptions. Using Streamlit for the user interface, the app allows users to input a job description and upload their resume in PDF format. The app then extracts text from the resume and uses a generative AI model to evaluate its alignment with the job description. The AI provides a matching percentage, identifies missing keywords, and generates a profile summary, offering targeted suggestions for improvement. This tool streamlines the resume review process, giving users valuable insights to enhance their resumes and increase their chances of success in a competitive job market.
