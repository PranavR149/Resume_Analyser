# Project Description
This project involves the development of an interactive web application designed to help users optimize their resumes based on specific job descriptions. The application integrates Google Gemini AI, specifically the "gemini-pro" model, to evaluate resumes and provide detailed feedback. Users can upload their resumes in PDF format and input a job description, and the AI model analyzes the resume, comparing it with the job description. The application generates a matching percentage, identifies missing keywords, and offers a profile summary to help users improve their resumes. The text from the uploaded PDF is extracted using PyPDF2, and the AI processes this text according to a customized prompt designed to mimic the functionality of a skilled Applicant Tracking System (ATS). The user-friendly interface, built with Streamlit, makes it easy for users to interact with the application and receive actionable insights to enhance their resumes for a competitive job market.
